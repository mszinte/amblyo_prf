To run the stereopsis stimulation:

It needs the PsychToolBox installed.
Make sure disk and pathName are appropriately defined to your folder path in the files paths, line 67-68.
Launch MRI_stam3.

If you just want to visualize the experiment, without using MRI goggles, edit the file to have stereoMode=2. When prompted for a DST name,
use defaut_DST.
